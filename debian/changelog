libsdl2-mixer (2.8.0+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream stable release
  * d/copyright: Exclude vendored minimp3.
    We don't use this in Debian, so there's little value in reviewing new
    versions or tracking their copyright status in d/copyright.
  * d/copyright: Update
  * d/libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0.symbols: Update
  * d/rules: Update build options to enable/disable codecs.
    GME (game music emulation) and WavPack are disabled for now,
    to minimize dependencies and security exposure. Enabling them in
    future would be a compatible change, if a game in Debian needs them,
    but disabling them after they were enabled would be an incompatible
    change, so the conservative approach is to start small.
  * d/clean: Fix FTBFS-twice-in-a-row by removing regenerated files
    (Closes: #1046994)
  * d/gbp.conf: Only sign packaging tags, not upstream tags
  * d/gbp.conf: Rely on uscan to repack upstream source.
    This will use Files-Excluded in d/copyright, rather than separate
    configuration.
  * d/gbp.conf: Use DEP-14 branch names

  * d/upstream/metadata: Add

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * New upstream stable release
    - Functionally equivalent to 2.6.2+dfsg-2
    - Drop patch from 2.6.2+dfsg-2, applied upstream
  * d/copyright: Update

    The upstream 'main' branch now targets SDL 3 (under development), and

  * Team upload
  * New upstream snapshot
  * d/copyright: Update
  * d/rules: Don't explicitly specify SHLIBVER.
    Specifying a version for dh_makeshlibs, and remembering to increment it
    every time new ABI is added, is error-prone. In debhelper compat level
    12 and up, the default is to generate a conservative dependency using
    dh_makeshlibs -VUpstream-Version. The symbols file (which is more
    precise) also takes precedence over the shlibs version.

libsdl2-mixer (2.0.5~20211214.gffd0589+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Team upload
  * Branch for experimental
  * New upstream snapshot
    - Drop patches, applied upstream
    - d/copyright: Update
  * Add a .symbols file
  * d/copyright, d/gbp.conf: Filter more generated/vendored files.
    If we're repacking the tarball *anyway*, we might as well exclude these
    too. They'll be restored by dh_autoreconf.
  * Escape CPPFLAGS properly, so -fvisibility=hidden gets enabled.
    We had the wrong number of layers of escaping here, resulting in a
    compiler warning which indirectly disabled detection of
    -fvisibility=hidden.
  * Bump debhelper compat level from 12 to 13
    + debian/rules: Drop --fail-missing argument to dh_missing, which is
      now the default.
  * Re-export upstream signing key without extra signatures.
  * Drop transition for old debug package migration.
    The legacy -dbg package was replaced by -dbgsym in Debian 10, and we
    don't support skipping a release when upgrading.
  * Standards-Version: 4.6.0 (no changes required)

    music_fluidsynth.c, which would cause a segmentation fault with

      format.
    + Add the soundfont file to the MIX_INIT_SOUNDFONT_PATHS macro.
